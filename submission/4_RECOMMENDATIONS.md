## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

### 1. Deploy Mobile Vans to Top 15 Urgency Districts

**Target Districts:** (Based on urgency score)
- Districts with highest enrollment but lowest update rates
- Focus on Thane, Sitamarhi, Bahraich, Murshidabad

**Implementation:**
```
Phase 1 (Q1): 5 vans in top 5 districts
Phase 2 (Q2): 5 vans in next 5 districts
Phase 3 (Q3): 5 vans in remaining 5 districts
```

**Expected Impact:** 
- +15% compliance rate within 6 months
- 50,000+ additional updates captured

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

### 5. Audit Flagged Fraud Clusters

**Findings:** 121 geographic clusters with synchronized demographic spikes

**Actions:**
1. Cross-reference with election dates
2. Check for subsidy announcement correlation
3. Investigate repeat operator patterns

**Expected Impact:**
- Risk mitigation
- Data integrity improvement

## Resource Allocation Formula

Based on our analysis, we propose the following resource allocation model:

```
Resources(district) = Base × (1 + Growth_Factor) × Compliance_Gap_Factor

Where:
- Base = Standard allocation
- Growth_Factor = Enrollment growth rate / National average
- Compliance_Gap_Factor = 1 + (Expected - Actual updates) / Expected
```
